Uber Ride Analytics Dashboard â€“ Project Story
Objective

This project aimed to design an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer ride patterns, vehicle usage, booking behaviours, and payment preferences. By visualising these insights, the dashboard helps business stakeholders understand operational performance, customer habits, and opportunities to optimize the ride-hailing service.

Data & Cleaning Process

The dataset contained Uber ride booking details, including booking dates, pickup and drop-off locations, vehicle types, waiting time (VTAT), completion time (CTAT), ride distance, and payment methods.
I began by cleaning the dataset â€” handling missing values, standardizing categorical variables (vehicle types, payment modes), and ensuring consistency in date/time columns for temporal analysis.

Outliers such as extreme ride distances and unusual ride times were examined and filtered to avoid skewed insights.

Key Insights Delivered

Total Bookings

The dashboard highlights 9,000 total rides analysed. This KPI card sets the stage for performance tracking.

Seasonal Ride Trends

A line/area chart tracks monthly booking volumes, showing peaks in certain months (e.g., July and November).

This insight helps in identifying seasonal demand fluctuations and supports resource planning.

Ride Performance by Vehicle Type

A clustered bar chart compares average waiting time (VTAT) with average completion time (CTAT) across different vehicle types (Uber XL, Go Mini, Auto, etc.).

This reveals efficiency differences â€” for example, smaller vehicles often have shorter waiting times, while larger vehicles have longer ride durations.

Ride Distance Analysis

A line chart shows average ride distance by vehicle type, highlighting that eBikes and Go Sedans tend to cover longer trips compared to bikes or Premier Sedans.

Payment Preferences

The bar chart reveals UPI as the most preferred payment method, followed by cash. Cards and wallets are less popular.

This insight can guide promotional strategies or partnerships with payment providers.

Pickup & Drop-off Hotspots

Filters allow users to analyze the most popular pickup and drop locations. This is crucial for understanding demand clusters and improving driver allocation.

Design Considerations

Interactive Filters: Users can drill down by payment method, pickup location, and drop location to personalise the insights.

Minimalist Layout: The dashboard is kept clean and straightforward, allowing users to focus on insights without visual clutter.

Comparative Analysis: Multiple charts were used to compare metrics (e.g., CTAT vs VTAT), making patterns easy to spot.

Impact

This project demonstrates how data visualisation can uncover operational inefficiencies, customer preferences, and demand patterns in the ride-hailing industry. The dashboard can be extended further with real-time data, customer segmentation, or cancellation analysis to enhance decision-making for stakeholders.
